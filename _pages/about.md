# Diana Mandache, PhD
**Senior Data Scientist – Medical Imaging & Clinical AI (Paris, FR)**

I build **robust, interpretable AI systems** for **high-stakes medical decision-making**, bridging research and real-world clinical constraints.

- 10+ years in Python-based scientific computing
- Deep learning for medical imaging (CT, MRI, OCT, H&E)
- Experience across academia, hospital data, and **CE-marked medical devices**

**Currently:** multimodal clinical pipelines + generative modeling for **liver oncology** at HeKA and AP-HP.

My work typically includes:
- **Large-scale multimodal pipelines** (imaging + clinical + longitudinal data)
- **Deep learning** for diagnosis, stratification, and representation learning
- **Interpretability and validation** for clinically credible models
- Close collaboration with **radiologists and clinicians**
- Project ownership from **requirements → data → modeling → evaluation**

Outside work I enjoy exploring Paris, live music, and finding the best pastries in town.

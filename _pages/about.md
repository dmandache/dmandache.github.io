Hi! I’m Diana 👋  
I work on **AI for medical imaging**, with a focus on building **robust, interpretable models** that can actually be used in **clinical practice**.

Over the past decade, I’ve worked across **research labs, hospitals, and medical-device startups**, helping translate machine learning ideas into tools that support real medical decisions.

**Currently**, I’m developing **multimodal clinical pipelines and generative models** for **liver oncology** at **HeKA / AP-HP**.

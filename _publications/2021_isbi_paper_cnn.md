title: 'Leveraging Global Diagnosis For Tumor Localization In Dynamic Cell Imaging Of Breast Cancer Tissue Towards Fast Biopsying'

excerpt: 'We propose a fast aid-to-diagnosis biopsy assessment method convenient at the point-of-care, on account of both the imaging technique and the algorithm applied. The procedure implies a pipeline of classification and localization of tumors in breast cancer biopsies imaged with a recently developed non-invasive imaging modality: Dynamic Cell Imaging (aka Dynamic Full Field Optical Coherence Tomography). This allows for fast and interpretable extemporaneous cancer detection with high confidence; we obtained a performance of 96% classification accuracy together with a coarse localization of tumors, even so for single isolated invasive cells.'

We propose a method to fully exploit the dynamic signal produced by a recently developed non-invasive imaging modality: Dynamic Cell Imaging based on Full Field Optical Coherence Tomography, towards fast extemporaneous tissue assessment. The non-negative matrix factorisation method is used in an interpretable and quantifiable fashion to extract the signals coming from different structures of breast tissue in order to characterize cancerous tissue.

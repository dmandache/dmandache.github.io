title: 'Blind Source Separation in Dynamic Cell Imaging using NonNegative Matrix Factorization applied to Breast Cancer Biopsies'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021_isbi_paper_nmf
excerpt: 'We propose a method to fully exploit the dynamic signal produced by a recently developed non-invasive imaging modality: Dynamic Cell Imaging based on Full Field Optical Coherence Tomography, towards fast extemporaneous tissue assessment. The non-negative matrix factorisation method is used in an interpretable and quantifiable fashion to extract the signals coming from different structures of breast tissue in order to characterize cancerous tissue.'
